## Light and bright pink

To represent the «human» dimension, light and bright pink will be mainly used. This part of the color wheel is reminiscent of Ginetta’s «warm, authentic, approachable» side.

## Bright purple

To represent the «brave» dimension, the bright purple will be mainly used. This part of the color wheel is reminiscent of the «sharp, resilient, daring» side of Ginetta.

## Bright green and light blue

To represent the «active» dimension, bright green and light blue will be mainly used. This part of the color wheel is reminiscent of Ginetta’s «agile, growth, continuous» side.
